# BEST_PRICE = SELL_PRICE - BUY_PRICE
def picker(prices)
# Step 1:
  # Get input array of stock prices from user
# Step 2:
  # Create variable to hold current best price to buy
# Step 3:
  # Create variable to hold current best price to sell
# Step 3: 
  # Loop through array
# Step 4:
  # While in loop
# Step 4a:
  # Compare current value of variable to current index of array for highest sell price
# Step 4aa:
  # If current index value is higher, assign index value to variable, 
# Step 4ab:
  # Otherwise continue
# Step 4b:
  # Compare current value of variable to current index of array for lowest buy price
# Step 4ba:
  # If current index value is lower, assign index value to variable
# Step 4bb:
  # Otherwise continue

# Step 5:
  # Implement functionality so sell can only be after buy

# Step 5a:
  # Best price formula = sell_price - buy_price

# Step 6:
  # Return buy_price, sell_price in new array
